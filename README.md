# Scientific Computing with Python

This repository contains my solutions to FreeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python curriculum. Each includes an additional self-written unit test, and a short explanation of the rules and requirements of the project. 

#### From FreeCodeCamp:

> The Scientific Computing with Python curriculum will equip you with the skills to analyze and manipulate data using Python, a powerful and versatile programming language. You'll learn key concepts like data structures, algorithm, Object Oriented Programming, and how to perform complex calculations using a variety of tools.  
> This comprehensive course will guide you through the fundamentals of scientific computing, including data structures, and algorithms.
